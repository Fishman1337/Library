<h2>Inspiring Libraries: Buntingford’s response </h2>

Executive Summary

	<p>1. The Library Service’s proposals are misguided and do not appreciate the special needs of the town.</p>

   <p>2. Buntingford’s geographical location is isolated and rural compared to the rest of the county.</p>

   <p>3.  The Buntingford library services not only the residents of the town but also those of some 28 surrounding villages.</p>

   <p>4. Unprecedented and uncontrolled housing development will see the town double in size over the next few years.</p>

   <p>5. The new residents will be largely employed outside the town creating an enormous challenge to integrate them into the town life.</p>

   <p>6. The current location of the library and the opportunity of offering facilities to local societies and clubs means that it has a key role in maintaining the town’s social life.</p>

   <p>7. Any proposal to relocate the library to smaller premises will seriously prejudice the town as a shopping centre.</p>

   <p>8. The Library Service’s proposals are a concern to our local schools who view the library as important in developing literacy among the young.</p>

   <p>9. The proposals do not reflect the dedicated and brilliant work of the four library assistants who have consistently outperformed their targets although they are only part-time.</p>

   <p>10. The significant response to our petition, which has also been expressed at 4 public meetings, reflects the view of residents that the library should be retained in its present location and enhanced and the staff retained.</p>

   <p>11. The Library Service’s proposals do not inspire.   They need to be reconsidered.</p>


<p>The public consultation questionnaire “Inspiring Libraries” is disappointing as the information it contains is not adequate to enable residents to make an informed response and the questionnaire itself is open to misunderstanding.   Members of the public completing the form in Buntingford have sought to indicate their opposition to the proposals, but have ticked the “reasonable” box believing it to relate to the current service they enjoy at Buntingford.   Nor have they always answered the questions relating to the mobile service, thinking that as they live in the town these questions are not relevant to them.   This paper is intended to provide a more considered and detailed response which will enable the County Library Service to better understand the views of the users of the library in Buntingford.</p>

<p>There is a considerable amount which we support in the report of the Director Health and Community Services “Delivering the Inspiring Libraries Strategy” which was presented to the Customer Service, Performance and Libraries Panel on 19 September 2014.   The three main themes set out in that paper represent an admirable ambition, namely:-</p>

        <p>The library as a vibrant community asset. <br>
        The digital library – exploiting technology for the benefit of residents <br>
        The library as an enhanced gateway to reading, information and wellbeing <br> </p>

<p>We consider, however, that placing the Buntingford library in Tier3 will not realise these ambitions in our town, and we feel it is relevant to recall the history of the library service in Buntingford, which goes back some 90 years.   It was not until 1919 that rural areas enjoyed a rate funded library service with the passing of the County Libraries Act and the Hertfordshire County Library came to Buntingford in about 1924.   This consisted of a dozen or so stout wooden boxes with lockable lids which were deposited in the Parish Room and opened for a few hours a week under the supervision of the Vicar’s wife for residents to borrow books.   The books were sent out from Hertford in a contractor’s lorry and every so often the collection was exchanged.   Subsequently the library, still in its wooden boxes, was moved to the Technical Institute in Baldock Road, where, after the Second World War, a room on the ground floor was fitted with shelves and the service was run by County library staff.  </p> 

<p>Its use grew rapidly with the result that the library became very cramped with no study place.   So when, in 1979, the premises at 77 High Street became available it moved for a second time.   The expansion of Buntingford in those years to about four times its original population and the town’s focus as a centre for the surrounding  villages and local farms ensured that the library became one of its most important and valued amenities.   The range of its services grew; study space became available, there was room for story hours for children, for exhibitions, even for slide shows and talks.  </p>

<p>The “Inspiring Libraries” strategy must build on this foundation of success, not prejudice it, and to do this a greater appreciation of the geographical location of Buntingford must be accepted.   Situated on the main through route from London to Cambridge (A10) in a predominantly rural part of the county, it is in fact not a village but a town, with its own Town Council and Mayor, an active Chamber of Commerce and a weekly Charter market which dates back to 1360.   The majority of the county’s libraries are located in the built-up western part of the county and are much closer to each other.   Thus the County Library’s strategy is likely to be more effective there.   By contrast East Herts is more poorly served and the nearest library to Buntingford is some 9 miles away in Royston.   Even more distant are those at Bishop’s Stortford, Ware, Hertford and Stevenage.   Moreover, compared with Royston, Bishop’s Stortford, Sawbridgeworth, Hoddesdon and Cheshunt, the catchment area of Buntingford library is entirely within the county.   Sir Oliver Heald M.P.has been quoted as saying “(Buntingford) is an important town, some distance from other towns, and it’s providing a service not just for Buntingford but many others in the neighbourhood”.    To provide an effective, up-to-date library service in an area which will undoubtedly be adversely affected by the removal of the mobile library service will require a different approach.   Buntingford must be accepted as the hub of an extended rural are, and therefore accorded special treatment.</p>

<p>The Rural Services Network has highlighted the problems facing libraries in rural areas – smaller populations so less potential to develop footfall, an aging population, the scarcity of other service facilities, the availability of broadband and the extent of civic participation.   Many attempts to resolve these problems have included the use of volunteers, so it is clear where the Hertfordshire County Library Service is coming from.   But the same Rural Service Network, in another report, has found that village halls are struggling to find new volunteer recruits to manage the buildings.   Action with Communities in Rural England (ACRE) has found that while people want to use village halls, they do not want to commit to running them.   Younger people are especially hard to attract.   Why should it be any different for the library service?   We believe that enhancing the library service in Buntingford with qualified helpful staff, rather than downgrading it, is the answer to tackling these problems.    This may need a more innovative approach from the County Council and the position statement issued on 7 March 2014 entitled “Arts Council of England and communities living in rural England” reinforces this view.</p>

<p>The Arts Council states that people should not be disadvantaged by where they live.   Libraries, in particular, are welcoming and safe spaces where communities come together and are hugely important to rural digital infrastructure, learning and access to information and public services.   The contribution of libraries to rural public services is very important.   Very often they are the only public service in a locality and a service with a high level of trust and community awareness.   The Arts Council has encouraged libraries to play a role in supporting economic growth and has helped to fund 10 projects in which libraries use their role as community hubs to spark local economic growth and improve social mobility in communities across the country.   This approach is very relevant where Buntingford is concerned.</p>

<p>Where Buntingford is concerned there is an even more pressing problem if the town is to avoid being disadvantaged.   Recent articles in Country Life, the Daily Mail and reports on Anglia News and The Sunday Times Digital have highlighted the crisis which will be faced by the town as a result of the unprecedented increase in new housing of up to 1727 houses (see the map reproduced from the Daily Mail as Appendix 1).   While these reports have focussed primarily on the town’s inadequate infrastructure there will be another enormous challenge facing the town, namely how a doubling of the population can be assimilated within the life of the town, given that the majority will inevitably be working outside the town.  It is very possible that many of the new residents will be immigrants whose first language is not English.   Buntingford already has two non-British communities, Chinese and Bangladeshi, and the library  helped them to learn English and to become an active part of the town.  Responses to the questionnaire and the petition have emphasised how the library acts as the social hub of the community.   For the future wellbeing of Buntingford this must be maintained and enhanced, and any downsizing or relocation to smaller premises will prejudice the library’s ability to respond to this challenge.</p>

<p>One of the areas where the Arts Council has focussed on rural activity is Devon and the way Devon County Council is approaching its rural libraries is very interesting.   There a trialling of a new system of managing its libraries by converting the 10 larger ones into mutual societies or trusts as a way of saving money and generating income is expected to save enough to cover the costs of professional staff in 25 rural libraries.    While not suggesting that this specific approach should be adopted for Hertfordshire perhaps the County Library service should be giving more consideration to the rural libraries than those in the more highly populated region of the county.</p>

<p>The public questionnaire highlights the need of the County Council to cut costs.   However, we are concerned that a substantial amount of s106 money (almost £750,000), some of which could properly be used to support the library service, has been returned to the developers because it has not been used.   It is pleasing that the Council has now received £700,000 from the Government to support rural libraries but to use this to relocate 4 libraries to retained fire stations beggars belief.   Apart from anything else to put young children in close proximity to dangerous equipment flies in the face of Health & Safety principles and the Law takes a serious view of this.   It recognises a higher duty of care where children are concerned which means the cost of safety measures will be commensurately higher.   Would it not be more sensible to spend this money in enhancing the current library premises? </p>

<p>How then do we see the way ahead for the library service in Buntingford?</p>

<p>1. The decision to categorise Buntingford as Tier 3 is retrograde and likely to acerbate the problem.   It ignores the fact that with recently built, currently approved and planned housing developments of 1727 new houses the town’s population will double in the next few years (incidentally increasing the Council Tax income of the County Council).   Demand for the library’s services can be expected to increase proportionally.   Moreover there will be a similar increase in the population of the surrounding villages.   For example Braughing already has two new housing estates and a further one of 60 houses proposed although not approved; Puckeridge has a substantial new estate being built and another one of 180 houses proposed.   With the elimination of the mobile library service which visits both villages they will become even more dependent on the Buntingford library.   The overall population growth and an increased emphasis on the Home Library service, where the library already covers 34 drop off points suggests that Buntingford library should be at least Tier 2 if not Tier 1.</p>


<p>2. The location of the  present library building in the High Street must be maintained, not only because of its ease of access (56% of respondents to the original survey walk to the library) but also because 86% combine their visits with shopping, a higher percentage than for the survey as a whole.   Three hours free parking, thanks to the Town Council, is obviously a factor and the High Street shopkeepers have indicated that any downgrading or relocation of the library could have a serious prejudicial impact on the town as a shopping centre.   The library is also disabled friendly: there is a disabled parking bay immediately outside and the doors can be opened automatically.</p>

<p>3. The library fulfils an important role in the social life of the town.   This must be nurtured and enhanced.   The weekly Story Time sessions introduce young children to the idea of books and visiting the library; at the other end of the scale, the monthly meetings of the Local History Group have been flourishing for over two years (an initiative of one of the library staff) and are a valuable function in preserving the memories and experiences of our older residents; many local book clubs are supported; and the Buntingford Community Choir has used the premises to warm up before a performance.   Regrettably, despite some interest, there have been very few visits by authors.       </p>

<p>4. The premises can be adapted to attract local societies and clubs to use them and the physical changes would not be major.    At present there is a steep ramp which connects to the office area in the rear of the building which apparently does not conform to present-day health & safety requirements.   Proposals in the past to rectify this have largely fallen on deaf ears. A folding threshold ramp for the rear access door would cost only £245.  To replace the existing ramp with steps and a disabled platform lift (like the one in the John Lewis WGC restaurant) would not be hugely expensive and could be accommodated in the Library Service’s stated commitment to investment in library buildings.   This would then open the rooms at the back to be adapted for a variety of uses such as an art gallery, music rooms, drama rooms, lectures, classes and societies.   Enquiries have already been received for running dance classes and holding a monthly film show.   In the past such enquiries have largely failed to progress because of an unrealistic charging rate.  It is encouraging to note that the latest consultation document accepts that the local hire rates should be applied and mentions the possibility of swipe card access which would increase the opportunity for evening events.   Nor has there been much publicity about the availability of these facilities.   This can be addressed:  The Buntingford Civic Society publishes the Buntingford Journal 10 times a year detailing up-coming events as does the weekly Buntingford and Royston edition of the Mercury.   Both are currently available in the library.   We can also publicise events on our website: www.buntingfordlibrarysupportersclub.com, and also on Facebook.</p> 

<p>5. As an educational centre the library’s close relationship with the students of local schools must be maintained.   This will be important bearing in mind that the forecast housing growth will also increase the student population.   In this connection it is relevant to bear in mind that the Library Service’s profile of active borrowers 2013/2014 for the Buntingford library puts young people 0-15 at 42.88% and young people 16-17 at 0.12%, a total of 43%, whereas those aged 18-64 are shown as 34.77%.   These statistics emphasize the vital need to continue to encourage young people to use the library’s facilities.   The current library staff have been very successful in this : for example on World Book Day all local schools participated and processed up the High Street to the library in fancy dress.   It is suggested useful links with the school PTAs might be developed.   Kathy Willett, the head teacher of Millfield First and Nursery School,  has said: “It (the library) is something many of our children use and especially for our less well-off parents it is an opportunity for their children to access books”.   With the national concern over the low literacy levels in Britain a viable attractive library in Buntingford is essential to our long-term investment in learning and young people.   This needs a trained professional library staff not volunteers, however enthusiastic.</p>

<p>We support the vision for the Library Service as set out in the original document:</p>
        <p>To enable individuals to access knowledge, information and cultural resources, to provide safe spaces to read borrow and learn, and to enrich communities.</p>

<p>It is disappointing that the latest consultative document seems to ignore the way Buntingford library has progressed under the present staff.   The latest performance indicators for the library show that book issues have increased from 2012/2013 by 11.06%; actual visits to the library have gone up by 5.5%; and the number of active borrowers has increased by 10.22%.    This is not a library in decline.   These statistics only serve to reinforce the response by Buntingford residents to the original survey when there were 383 respondents from the town, equivalent to 2.5% of the total.   By contrast the average number of responses for the whole survey was 336 – the Buntingford response was almost 14% higher.   Buntingford residents were more likely to be exclusive users (54% against 32%).   This undoubtedly reflects the more isolated location of the town compared with the rest of the county and highlights the argument for a more preferential treatment.</p>

<p>The success of Buntingford library and its importance in the town’s life is due in no small measure to its staff.   This largely comprises four part-time experienced library assistants (formerly six) whose committed and sympathetic approach over many years has made the library such a welcoming place.   Their knowledge of the books is unequalled, across fiction, non-fiction, children’s books and large print, so much so that they can advise borrowers on books that are likely to be of interest to them, or new authors they might enjoy reading; they are equally adept in assisting the elderly in using the computers, which is becoming more important with the trend to on-line billing; they can relate to young children, teenagers or old-age pensioners with equal facility – indeed for the latter they often provide the only friendly face in a lonely life.   This is why the library has become in a real sense the social heart of the community and is so critical in maintaining the mental health of many residents.   In recognition of their valuable service the total cost of their combined salaries amounts to not much more than £30,000 p.a.   How can the County Library service suggest that switching to volunteers is justified economically when all this would be put in jeopardy?</p>

<p>It is clear that the town actively supports its library.   A meeting to discuss the questionnaire early in October was attended by around 50 residents and even more attended another meeting on 3 November when Andrew Bignall and Councillor Tony Hunter were present.   A further vocal meeting was held on 1 December when Councillor Frances Button, Councillor Tony Hunter and Taryn Pearson attended.   A petition has been widely circulated in the town and has been signed by 1779; a website has been set up and 437 have signed the on-line petition; and there has been a positive response on Facebook, with 694 “likes” recorded.  This informal group, the Buntingford Library Supporters Club, that organised these meetings and the petition, can continue in the future to assist in promoting events at the library.   This is a groundswell of public opinion which cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we recommend that the Cabinet Panel consider:- </p>
<p>1.	Buntingford library is not downgraded or relocated, but should be at least Tier 2, with consideration to including it in Tier 1 to meet the future increasing demands which cannot be met from elsewhere in the county.</p>
<p>2.	The present library staff, who do a brilliant job, be retained to ensure that the future demands are covered competently and to assist in income-generating activities.</p>
<p>3.	The library building be maintained in its present location and adapted to meet the current disabled and health and safety requirements and to facilitate hiring space to outside organisations.</p>
<p>4.	Increased liaison with local schools and PTAs is explored to enhance the library’s educational function.</p>

<p>When last month Buntingford Chamber of Commerce organised late night shopping there were 534 people in the library.   We do not think any virtual librarian would cope with this.</p>


 <p>This paper was prepared by the Buntingford Library Supporters Club on behalf of the residents of Buntingford and the surrounding area and approved at a meeting on 1 December 2014.   A selection of the many comments by respondents to the on-line petition is attached as Appendix 2.</p>
